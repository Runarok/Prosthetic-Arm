# ProstheticArm

This is the official repository for the prosthetic arm project, but it isn’t a fully polished or high-gloss documentation set.  
It’s a functional collection of everything that supported the work: references, summaries, brainstorming notes, prototype thoughts, and early design directions.  
Not perfect, not empty — just the actual material that carried the project forward.

The repo keeps all the phases and supporting files in one place so the full context isn’t lost, even if the documentation isn’t written as a “final book” or a step-by-step guide.

## Repository Structure

### **phase-01/**
Initial semester submissions: summaries, reference notes, review PPTs, and reports.  
These reflect the academic requirements and early understanding of the project.

### **phase-02/**
Concept thinking, alternatives explored, revised objectives, and early mechanical ideas.  
This phase has the raw design direction and the reasoning behind different choices.

### **resources/**
AI-generated prosthetic arm guide and a large set of references.  
Useful for anyone who wants to understand the broader landscape, even if it’s not curated into a single narrative.

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is simple:
- Keep all the work in one place.
- Preserve the thought process behind the prosthetic arm design.
- Help others see the direction, challenges, references, and considerations involved.
- Serve as the official project archive, even if it isn’t refined into a fully structured documentation set.

This is the real project — not over-polished, not under-developed.  
Just a complete record of how the work was done.
